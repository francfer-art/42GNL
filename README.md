## Introduction

Welcome to get_next_line! This project aims to provide a function that reads a line from a file descriptor, one line at a time, handling various scenarios and edge cases.

## Overview

The get_next_line function allows you to read text files or input from the standard input (stdin) and returns the line that was read. It handles repeated calls (e.g., using a loop) to read the text file, ensuring that each call retrieves the next line.

## Requirements

Here are the key requirements for the get_next_line function:

```
Repeated calls to get_next_line() should let you read the text file pointed to by the file descriptor, one line at a time.
The function should return the line that was read. If there is nothing else to read or if an error occurred, it should return NULL.
Ensure that the function works as expected both when reading a file and when reading from the standard input (stdin).
The returned line should include the terminating \n character, except if the end of the file was reached and does not end with a \n character.
Your header file get_next_line.h must contain at least the prototype of the get_next_line() function.
Add all the necessary helper functions in the get_next_line_utils.c file.
```
## Additional Instructions

Here are some additional instructions for compiling and handling the project:

```
To define the buffer size for read(), add the option -D BUFFER_SIZE=n to your compiler call, where n is the buffer size value.
The buffer size value will be modified by your peer-evaluators and the Moulinette for testing purposes.
You must be able to compile this project with and without the -D BUFFER_SIZE flag in addition to the usual flags.
The function has undefined behavior if the file pointed to by the file descriptor changed since the last call, whereas read() didn’t reach the end of the file.
The function also has undefined behavior when reading a binary file. However, you can implement a logical way to handle this behavior if you want to.
```

## Getting Started

To use Libft in your project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
https://github.com/francfer-art/42GNL.git
```

3. Include the library in your project:

```c
    #include get_next_line.h
```

4. You will compile your code as follows, where a buffer size of 42 is used as an example:

```bash
    gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -D BUFFER_SIZE=42 <files>.c
```

## Usage

Once the library is successfully integrated into your project, you can start using the functions in your code. Refer to the Libft Wiki for detailed documentation on each function.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include "get_next_line.h"

int main(void)
{
    int fd;
    char *line;

    // Open a file for reading
    fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);
    if (fd < 0)
    {
        perror("Error opening file");
        return 1;
    }

    // Read lines from the file using get_next_line
    while ((line = get_next_line(fd)) != NULL)
    {
        printf("%s\n", line);
        free(line); // Free the memory allocated by get_next_line
    }

    // Close the file descriptor
    close(fd);

    return 0;
}


```

## Bonus


Bonus Part: Enhanced get_next_line()

This bonus part challenges you to enhance the get_next_line() function by implementing it using only one static variable. Additionally, your enhanced get_next_line() should be capable of managing multiple file descriptors simultaneously. This means that the function should seamlessly handle reading from different file descriptors without losing the reading thread of each file descriptor or returning a line from another file descriptor.

Here are the requirements for the bonus part:

Develop get_next_line() using only one static variable.
Ensure that your get_next_line() function can manage multiple file descriptors at the same time.
For instance, if you can read from file descriptors 3, 4, and 5, your function should be able to read from a different file descriptor per call without losing the reading thread of each file descriptor or returning a line from another file descriptor. This implies that you should be able to call get_next_line() to read from file descriptor 3, then 4, then 5, and so forth, seamlessly switching between file descriptors as needed.

This bonus part challenges your creativity and coding skills to implement a robust and efficient version of get_next_line() that can handle multiple file descriptors concurrently while maintaining a clean and manageable codebase. Good luck!
